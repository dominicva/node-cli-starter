- Readme in progress :))
- Not yet published to npm, for now you can:

## Run on your local machine

- get the code
- run: &nbsp; `npm install`
- at the project root run &nbsp; `npm link`
- you should then be able to run &nbsp; `ncli` and follow the prompts to generate your new project in your current working directory
