# node cli project starter cli

> Not a typo: a cli to generate a starter node cli project

- Readme in progress :))
- Not yet published to npm, for now you can:

## Run on your local machine

- get the code
- run: `npm install`
- at the project root run `npm link`
- you should then be able to run `ncli` and follow the prompts to generate your new project in your current working directory
